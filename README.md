# Snake Game
Snake Game is a console-based game developed for the Algorithm course project. The game was built using the C++ programming language.

## Description
This project is a console-based snake game where the player controls a snake to eat food and grow longer. The game includes features such as scoring, collision detection, and game over conditions. The game is played on a console/terminal and uses ASCII character designs.

The source code is written in C++ and is stored in .cpp files. The game needs to be compiled using a C++ compiler before it can be played.

## Method or Topic
The Snake Game was developed as a project for the Algorithm course, where we learned about various algorithms related to game development, such as collision detection algorithms and algorithms for updating game state. We applied these concepts in building the Snake Game.

## How to Run
To run the Snake Game, you will need to compile the source code using a C++ compiler. Once compiled, you can execute the resulting binary file to start the game. The game will be displayed on the console/terminal.

## Acknowledgements
We would like to thank our Algorithm course instructor for giving us the opportunity to work on this project and learn about various algorithms related to game development.
